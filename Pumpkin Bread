Pumpkin Bread

Ingredients:
- 430g Pumpkin Puree (15oz)
- 4 Eggs
- 225g Neutral Oil (Vegetable, Canola, Avocado, etc.) (1c)
- 160g Water (2/3c)
- 200g White Sugar (3c)
- 420g Flour (3.5c)
- 10g Baking Soda (2tsp)
- 9g Salt (1.5tsp)
- 3g Ground Cinnamon (1tsp)
- 2.5g Ground Nutmeg (1tsp)
- 1g Ground Cloves (0.5tsp)
- 1g Ground Ginger (0.25tsp)
- 5g Vanilla (1-2tsp)
- Chocolate chips (measure with heart)

Steps:
1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Mix dry ingredients
3. Gradually incorporate puree, oil, and water with whisk
4. Gently whisk in eggs, one at a time
5. Fold until homogeneous
6. Pour into 3x greased standard (~7x3") loaf pans
6a. I only have one loaf pan so I used that, a small
    cupcake tin (dozen), and a small (6") CI skillet
7. Bake ~50mins until clean toothpick
7a. 50 mins for loaf pan, 25-30 for cupcakes, 30-35 for skillet
8. Allow to cool completely

Notes:
+ I added ice cubes to steam the oven
+ As always, room temp ingredients
+ I recommend doubling or tripling the spices - personal preference
++ 3 parts cinnamon, 2 ginger, 1-2 nutmeg, feel free to add allspice
   in proportion to nutmeg, cloves are strong but it's difficult to
   overdo it
