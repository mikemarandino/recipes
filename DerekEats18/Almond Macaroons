Preheat the oven to 350°E. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or foil.
In a food processor or the large bowl of an electric mixer, combine the almond paste and sugar. Process or beat until blended. Add the egg whites and process or beat until very smooth.
Scoop up 1 tablespoon of the batter and lightly roll itinto a ball. Dampen your fingertips with cool water if necessary to prevent sticking. Place on a prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining batter, placing the balls about 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Push a candied cherry or almond into the top of each cookie.
Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly browned. Let cool briefly on the baking sheets. With a thin metal spatula, transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely.
Store the cookies in airtight containers.
