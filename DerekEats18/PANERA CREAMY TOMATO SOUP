PANERA CREAMY TOMATO SOUP COPYCAT RECIPE 
TOTAL TIME:30 MINUTES
To make your meal perfect, make a grilled cheese with fresh thick crusty sourdough bread, havarti cheese and a
ton of real butter. That is my PERFECT grilled cheese.
INGREDIENTS:
« 2 tablespoons olive oil
+ 4 garlic cloves, minced
« 1 large yellow onion, sliced
+ 2 (28 0z) cans San Marzano peeled tomatoes + 1 cup chicken stock (or vegetable stock)
- 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
+ 8 large fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes
+ kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste + 1/3 cup shredded parmesan cheese, optional
* buttery croutons, optional topping
DIRECTIONS:
1. In a heavy bottomed pot (or dutch oven), heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic and saute for 30
seconds — until fragrant. Add onion and cook, stirring as needed, until translucent — about 8 minutes.
2. Add San Marzano peeled tomatoes (juice and all), chicken stock, and sugar. Bring to a low simmer. Cook uncovered, for 12 minutes or until it has thickened.
3. Add the heavy cream, basil, oregano, red pepper flakes and season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Using an immersion blender (or carefully transfer soup to a blender), puree soup until there are no large chunks left.
5. OPTIONAL: stir in parmesan cheese and serve topped with buttery croutons.
. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
