Ingredients
11b Ribeye steak trimmed and thinly sliced*
1/2 tsp Sea salt or to taste
1/2 tsp Black pepper or to taste
1 sweet onion (large), diced
8 slices provolone cheese mild (not aged provolone) 4 Hoagie Rolls sliced 3/4 through
2 Thsp unsalted butter softened
1 garlic clove pressed
2-4 Tbsp mayonnaise or to taste
Instructions 1. Slice hoagie rolls 3/4 of the way through with a serrated knife. Dice onions and thinly slice beef*
2. In a small bowl, stir together 2 Thsp softened butter with 1 pressed garlic clove. Spread garlic butter onto the cut sides of 4 hoagie roll. Toast the buns on a large skillet, flat cooktop or griddle on medium heat until golden brown then set aside.
3. Add 1 Thsp oil to your pan/cooktop and sautee diced onions until caramelized then transfer to a bowl.
4. Increase to high heat and add 1 Thsp oil. Spread the super thinly sliced steak in an even layer. Let brown for a couple of minutes undisturbed then flip and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Sautee until steak is fully cooked through then stir in the caramelized onions.
5. Divide into 4 even portions and top each with 2 slices of cheese and turn off the heat so the cheese will melt without overcooking the meat.
6. Spread a thin layer of mayo on the toasted side of each roll. Working with one portion at a time, place a toasted bun over each portion and use a spatula to scrape the cheesy beef into your bun as you flip it over. Serve warm.
