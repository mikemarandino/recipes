Ingredients e 8 veal cutlets
e 8 slices prosciutto e § leaves fresh sage e 1 tsp Butter
* 1tbsp Olive ol
e 4 - % cl white wine ¢ 1 pinch salt
* 1 pinch pepper

Instructions
1. Trim any connective tissue and loose meat off of the veal scallops, then pound them thinly between two sheets of wax paper or plastic wrap.
2. Lay a thin slice of prosciutto and one sage leaf on top of each veal scallop, securing all of the layers together with a wooden toothpick.

3. Heat a large stainless steel or copper skillet on the stove and add a splash of
olive oil and a dab of butter.
4. Once the butter is melted, place the veal in the pan sage-side down and brown for up to one minute. Be careful not to leave it too long, or the prosciutto will
. Flip each piece over and brown for another minute or so. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
. Arrange the veal on a serving platter, remove the toothpicks, and cover with folil to keep warm.
. Add the wine to the hot pan and stir to scrape up the sucs stuck on the bottom. Bring it to a boil, then cook for two to three minutes or until the sauce is reduced. The sauce should be silky and just thick enough that when you pull a spoon across the bottom of a pan, it leaves a clean trail behind it.
. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in another dab of butter, and pour the sauce over the veal. Enjoy the veal saltimbocca while it's still hot!
