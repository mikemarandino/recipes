Yield: 8 bowls

Ingredients
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast

Directions Step 1 In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
Step 2 Add salt, oil and 4 cups flour to the yeast mixture; beat well. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well with an electric mixer at medium speed after each addition.
Step 3
When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
Step 4
Punch dough down, and divide into 8 equal portions. Shape each portion into a 4 inch round loaf. Place loaves on lightly greased baking sheets sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, until doubled in bulk, about 35 minutes.
Step 5 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small bowl, beat together egg white and 1 tablespoon water; lightly brush the loaves with half of this egg wash.
Step 6 Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Brush with remaining egg mixture, and bake 10 to 15 more minutes or until golden. Cool on wire racks.
Step 7 To make bowls: Cut a 1/2 inch thick slice from top of each loaf; scoop out centers, leaving 3/4inch-thick shells. Fill bread bowls with hot soup and serve immediately.
